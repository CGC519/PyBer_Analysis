# PyBer_Analysis
## Overview
In this new analysis we looked at the type of city versus the fare types. The purpose was to analyze where we are seeing more rides, how much they are costing the client, and how many drivers we have supporting the market.

## Results
### Initial Analysis
During our initial analysis we realized there is a significant amount of rides in the urban areas compared to rural areas. As would be expected, the suburban ride count falls in between the rural ride count and the urban ride count. 
Since there is a larger market in the urban areas we see a significant amount of drivers in that area. We can also assume the rides in the urban areas are shorter distances, which results in a lower fare amount.

### City Type and Fare Cost
Through our second analysis of the data we realized that the total amount spent on fares was significantly higher in the urban areas. The suburban areas maintained the middle ground and the rural areas were the lowest line value. 
We see a spike in total fares across all regions in late February. The urban area has some smaller spikes in total fares throughout the month of March while suburban and rural numbers stay relatively neutral.

## Summary
Overall I have three recommendations for the CEO of this ride share company: 

    •	Lower fare cost in rural areas, where trips tend to be longer distances and less frequent, to encourage clients to utilize the ride share more often. 
    •	Apply incentives during periods of low activity to encourage more ride sharing. 
    •	Market towards the suburban demographic to encourage them to make more trips to the city.
